## Overview: <br />
A Statistical data analysis tool for WhatsApp message data. Employed Apache POI API to extract, process and export the data to an Excel sheet. The project then analyzed the data to generate various statistics and metrics such as frequency of message exchanges, average message length, and peak messaging hours, which were displayed on the front-end using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. The completed project is packaged (Maven) into an AWS S3 bucket and deployed on the cloud (AWS Elastic Beanstalk) with appropriate IAM roles, load balancers, security groups, and EC2 instances.  <br />
